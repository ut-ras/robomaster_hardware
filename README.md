# Onboarding test branch

Use this branch to get accustomed to the git & github workflow, the current files are just a copy of the turret branch.

**Use `git clone  --recursive [Repository URL]` to clone our hardware repo**, as not doing so will not copy the files needed from the [RAS KiCAD Library](https://github.com/ut-ras/KiCad_Library.git)

It will put you on the `main` branch first, use `git switch onboard` to switch to this onboard branch.

To get the URL for this onboarding branch use the green `<> Code` button and copy the URL.

To confirm you are done with onboarding, clone this branch, edit this markdown file according to the directions below, and stage/commit/push the changes to this github repo:
